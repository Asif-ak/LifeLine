## A Dot Net Core based Web Api project.


The project has been designed to roll-out a Free Non-Commercial web api based app. Currently, the web api is being prepared and soon a client app will also be rolled out.

This app is configured for Pakistani Cell/Mobile phone number, so anyone using it in another country will be required to make necessary changes in DonorEntities.cs. Number that is being accepted right now is in the this format: 923********* without (+) sign.

This api has 3 controllers:
* DonorController
* RequestorsController
* RequestsController
